## Project Overview

**LinkedIn-Project** aims to provide core functionalities of a professional networking site, similar to LinkedIn. The project is divided into two main components:
- **Backend**: Handles the API, authentication, database operations, and core business logic using Python (likely Flask, given the presence of `app.py`).
- **Frontend**: The user interface is built using Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a component-driven architecture.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js (React, TypeScript)
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Modern JavaScript/TypeScript toolchain

- **Backend**:
  - Python (Flask or FastAPI assumed from `app.py`)
  - Google Firebase (serviceAccountKey.json suggests cloud services integration)
  - RESTful API structure

- **Other Tools**:
  - ESLint, PostCSS
  - Environment management (`.gitignore` in both projects)

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS version)
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```
    cd backend
    ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Ensure `serviceAccountKey.json` is valid for Firebase services used.
4. Run the backend server:
    ```
    python app.py
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install node dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

- The backend will run (by default) on `http://localhost:5000` (ensure to check or update as needed).
- The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Endpoints and UI routes to be documented as they are implemented.
